 Primary view controller for what is displayed by the application.
 
 In this class we configure an \c MKMapView to display a floorplan, recieve
 location updates to determine floor number, as well as provide a few helpful
 debugging annotations.
 
 We will also show how to highlight a region that you have defined in PDF
